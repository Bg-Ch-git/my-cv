# a summary about you
summary: "I was born and graduated from school in Kazakhstan, studied and completed my master's degree in [Novosibirsk](https://english.nsu.ru/), Russia. At university I specialized in geometry and topology, or more precisely, knot theory. I studied representations of virtual braid groups. In parallel with my master's degree I entered the \"Data Science\" program at the [Yandex School of Data Analysis](https://dataschool.yandex.com/). Now I live and study [Bioinformatics](https://studieren.univie.ac.at/en/degree-programmes/master-programmes/bioinformatics-master/) and [Biomathematics](https://studieren.univie.ac.at/en/degree-programmes/master-programmes/mathematics-master/) in Vienna. As a hobby, I play the piano and love old music. Recently, I have been actively working on eliminating the gaps in my English and German skills."
